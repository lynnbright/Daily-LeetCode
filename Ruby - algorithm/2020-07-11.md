- Tag: `array`
- Difficulty: easy


## Description
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

## Example
```
#1
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

#2
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

## My Submission
```
def num_jewels_in_stones(j, s)
  s.split("").select do |x|
    j.split("").any?(x)
  end.count  
end
```

## Note： [Array - any?](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-any-3F)
```
[複習 Array 的 any? ]

any? [{ |obj| block }] → true or false
any?(pattern) → true or false

判斷某個陣列是否包含某字串、整數、block 內的回傳值。
```
